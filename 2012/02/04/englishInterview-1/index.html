<h3><span id="q6-whats-your-greatest-achievement">Q6 What’s your greatest achievement?  ***</span><a href="#q6-whats-your-greatest-achievement" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><ul>
<li>My greatest achievement has to be in my previous role when I worked as part of a team that managed to increase company sales by 25 in a year.</li>
<li>We achieved this by successfully launching new company products online and by upselling to previous customers.</li>
<li>The shift to marketing our products online made a massive difference to our sales figures, and I was very proud to be a part of the team that had so much success in that particular year.</li>
</ul>

<li>场景：It was Friday afternoon, and my manager came into the office to ask for a volunteer to put together some company sales figures which they needed urgently for a meeting at 4 pm. I put my hand up and volunteered to do the job for my manager. </li>
<li>任务：It was my responsibility to put together 3 years’ worth of historical company sales figures based on product type, serial number and the total sales generated. I literally had three hours to complete the task, so I set to work immediately.</li>
<li>行动：To make sure I completed the task on time and to the right standard, I created a spreadsheet with three columns and i then worked through each product meticulously, cross-checking as I went.</li>
<li>欢天喜地大结局：I only stopped for a short break once and by the time 4 pm had come along I had presented the figures to my manager. I enjoy working under pressure and my ability to remain calm and work meticulously is an advantage in situations like this.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="q8-where-do-you-see-yourself-in-five-years">Q8 Where do you see yourself in five years?  ***  ***</span><a href="#q8-where-do-you-see-yourself-in-five-years" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><ul>
<li>In five years from now, I will hopefully still be working for you either in this role or perhaps even having gained advancement to a higher level.</li>
<li>In five years, I will have developed into a trusted loyal and committed member of the company who can be relied upon to do a great job for you.</li>
<li>I feel in five years&#96; time I will have sufficient experience and expertise to help train up newer members of the organization as and when they join.</li>

<li>There were many things I liked such as the team I was a part of and how we all pulled together to get things done during tasks and projects.</li>
<li>I enjoyed the supportive working environment and the fact my manager was prepared to send people on training and development courses to ensure we all had the right skills and qualities needed to do our jobs properly.</li>
<li>I also like the fact my manager wasn’t afraid to say when she thought we could have done something better. This always ensured we all progressed both as individuals and as part of a team.</li>
<li>The only thing that slightly frustrated me about my last job is I did not feel we were ambitious enough in moving forward as a company.</li>
<li>We were successful, but I felt we could have achieved many more things, especially if we had embraced digital technology and the advertising opportunities that come with it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="q12-tell-me-about-a-time-you-took-the-initiative-to-solve-a-difficult-problem">Q12 Tell me about a time you took the initiative to solve a difficult problem.</span><a href="#q12-tell-me-about-a-time-you-took-the-initiative-to-solve-a-difficult-problem" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><ul>
<li>场景：A supplier contacted our company one day to explain a product they had been supplying us with was no longer available. This was a major problem because we already had several orders from customers who were waiting on this product. </li>
<li>任务：I saw it as my responsibility to use my initiative to find an alternative supplier who could supply the product moving forward.</li>
<li>行动： So I started researching online alternative suppliers.  I looked at their business history, their reviews, and their online company accounts to make sure they were reliable and trustworthy. I then drew up a shortlist of three companies and I contacted all of them to obtain quotes to suppliers with this product.</li>
<li>永远积极正向的结果：After speaking to all three companies, I chose the one that could provide the best value for money and that could also quickly supply us with the product so the customers who had already ordered the product were not left waiting.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="q13-what-are-your-strengths-and-weaknesses">Q13 What are your strengths and weaknesses?   *** ***</span><a href="#q13-what-are-your-strengths-and-weaknesses" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><ul>
<li><strong>My strengths</strong> include my ability to <strong>learn things very quickly and to work alone</strong>, unsupervised to a high standard. My <strong>strong communication skills</strong> and how I am a people- person are also other strengths.</li>
<li>I enjoy providing great service to customers and I will always positively represent your company brand. I am someone who adapts well to change, and I view it as an important aspect of both my own personal progression and company growth.</li>
<li><strong>My weakness</strong> is the fact I am <strong>not yet confident at speaking in front of large groups of people or giving presentations</strong>. However, this is certainly one area I want to improve in, and I’ve been reading a great book that has been helping me to start building confidence in this area.</li>
<li>I am the type of person who is always open to constructive feedback, so if you want me to develop in a particular area, just let me know and I will take the steps needed to develop.</li>

<li>场景创设：In my previous role a new member of our team joined the organization and I volunteered to help them settle into the role and to teach them how to carry out their duties to the correct standard. She was very nervous and shy, and when I spoke to her, it was clear that English was not her first language.</li>
<li>任务：It was my responsibility to welcome her to the team, to help make her feel valued, and to ascertain her level of skill so i could put a plan of action in place to train her.</li>
<li>采取的行动：Because of her shy personality, I wanted to encourage her to have more confidence in her abilities. It was clear she was going to be good at her job, but I just needed to help her get over the initial anxiety of joining a new team that she was unfamiliar with.</li>
<li>By introducing her to all team members, and by being patient with her whilst going through company procedures and training, her confidence levels started to improve dramatically.</li>
<li>永远的欢天喜地大结局：Within two weeks of joining, she was a fully trained up and confident member of the team who everyone valued.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="q17-describe-a-time-when-the-team-you-were-a-part-of-was-undergoing-some-change-how-did-the-change-impact-you-and-how-do-you-adapt">Q17 Describe a time when the team you were a part of was undergoing some change.

<li>In my previous job, a new manager came into the team and she wanted to make big changes to the way that we operated. This was a big thing for the team because the previous manager had not changed anything for many years.</li>
<li>I was quite excited about the change because I felt there were some things we could improve on. The change impacted me because I had to learn new skills and duties. Some members of the team were negative about the change, but I encouraged them to view it more positively and to see it as an opportunity for personal growth.</li>
<li>I adapted by being supportive of the change, by viewing it positively and by doing all I could to learn the new duties quickly and diligently. Change is a good thing and if you embrace it positive things can happen.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="q22-describe-yourself-in-three-words">Q22 Describe yourself in three words.</span><a href="#q22-describe-yourself-in-three-words" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><ul>
<li>I would describe myself as <strong>loyal, self-motivated, and commercially-aware</strong>.</li>
<li>Being a loyal employee means you can trust me to do a good job and to always be a good role model for your company.</li>
<li>Being self-motivated means, you will never have to pick me up for not doing my job properly either on time or to the necessary standard.</li>
<li>And being commercially aware means that I respect the fact that the only way your business will thrive is if people like me do a good job for your company, and I also seek to improve and develop year on year.</li>
