<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><p>Hello again! I hope you enjoyed Chapter 3 as much as I did. Watermarks are</p>
<p>a fascinating topic, and Slava knows them better than anyone on the planet.</p>
<p>Now that we have a deeper understanding of watermarks under our belts, I’d</p>
<p>like to dive into some more advanced topics related to the <em>what</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>,</p>
<p>and <em>how</em> questions.</p>
<p>We first look at <em>processing-time windowing</em>, which is an interesting mix of</p>
<p>both where and when, to understand better how it relates to event-time</p>
<p>windowing and get a sense for times when it’s actually the right approach to</p>
<p>take. We then dive into some more advanced event-time windowing concepts,</p>
<p>looking at <em>session windows</em> in detail, and finally making a case for why</p>
<p>generalized <em>custom windowing</em> is a useful (and surprisingly straightforward)</p>
<p>concept by exploring three different types of custom windows: <em>unaligned</em></p>
<p>fixed windows, <em>per-key</em> fixed windows, and <em>bounded</em> sessions windows.</p>
</details>


<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h1><span id="whenx2fwhere-processing-time-windows">*<strong>When*&#x2F;*Where*: Processing-Time Windows</strong></span><a href="#whenx2fwhere-processing-time-windows" class="header-anchor">#</a></h1><p>Processing-time windowing is important for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>For certain use cases, such as usage monitoring (e.g., web service</li>
</ul>
<p>traffic QPS), for which you want to analyze an incoming stream of</p>
<p>data as it’s observed, processing-time windowing is absolutely the</p>
<p>appropriate approach to take.</p>
<ul>
<li>For use cases for which the time that events happened is important</li>
</ul>
<p>(e.g., analyzing user behavior trends, billing, scoring, etc.),</p>
<p>processing-time windowing is absolutely the wrong approach to take,</p>
<p>and being able to recognize these cases is critical.</p>
<p>As such, it’s worth gaining a solid understanding of the differences between</p>
<p>processing-time windowing and event-time windowing, particularly given the</p>
<p>prevalence of processing-time windowing in many streaming systems today. —</p>
<p>When working within a model for which windowing as a first-class notion is</p>
<p>strictly event-time based, such as the one presented in this book, there are two</p>
<p>methods that you can use to achieve processing-time windowing: —</p>
<p>Triggers</p>
<p>​	Ignore event time (i.e., use a global window spanning all of event time)</p>
<p>​	and use triggers to provide snapshots of that window in the processing</p>
<p>​	time axis.</p>
<p>Ingress time</p>
<p>​	Assign ingress times as the event times for data as they arrive, and use</p>
<p>​	normal event-time windowing from there on. This is essentially what</p>
<p>​	something like Spark Streaming 1.x does.</p>
<p>Note that the two methods are more or less equivalent, although they differ</p>
<p>slightly in the case of multistage pipelines: in the triggers version, a</p>
<p>multistage pipeline will slice the processing-time “windows” independently at</p>
<p>each stage, so, for example, data in window <em>N</em> for one stage might instead end</p>
<p>up in window <em>N</em>–1 or <em>N</em>+1 in the following stage; in the ingress-time version,</p>
<p>after a datum is incorporated into window <em>N</em>, it will remain in window <em>N</em> for</p>
<p>the duration of the pipeline due to synchronization of progress between stages</p>
<p>via watermarks (in the Cloud Dataflow case), microbatch boundaries (in the</p>
<p>Spark Streaming case), or whatever other coordinating factor is involved at</p>
<p>the engine level. —</p>
<p>As I’ve noted to death, the big downside of processing-time windowing is</p>
<p>that the contents of the windows change when the observation order of the</p>
<p>inputs changes. To drive this point home in a more concrete manner, we’re</p>
<p>going to look at these three use cases: <em>event-time</em> windowing, <em>processing-time</em></p>
<p>windowing via triggers, and <em>processing-time</em> windowing via ingress time. —</p>
<p>Each will be applied to two different input sets (so six variations total). The</p>
<p>two inputs sets will be for the exact same events (i.e., same values, occurring</p>
<p>at the same event times), but with different observation orders. The first set</p>
<p>will be the observation order we’ve seen all along, colored white; the second</p>
<p>one will have all the values shifted in the processing-time axis as in Figure 4-</p>
<p>1, colored purple. You can simply imagine that the purple example is another</p>
<p>way reality could have happened if the winds had been blowing in from the</p>
<p>east instead of the west (i.e., the underlying set of complex distributed</p>
<p>systems had played things out in a slightly different order). —</p>

<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h3><span id="event-time-windowing"><strong>Event-Time Windowing</strong></span><a href="#event-time-windowing" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>To establish a baseline, let’s first compare fixed windowing in event time</p>
<p>with a heuristic watermark over these two observation orderings. We’ll reuse</p>
<p>the early&#x2F;late code from Example 2-7&#x2F;Figure 2-10 to get the results shown in</p>
<p>Figure 4-2. The lefthand side is essentially what we saw before; the righthand</p>
<p>side is the results over the second observation order. The important thing to</p>
<p>note here is that even though the overall shape of the outputs differs (due to</p>
<p>the different orders of observation in processing time), <em>the final results for the</em></p>
<p><em>four windows remain the same</em>: 14, 18, 3, and 12.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-2. Event-time windowing over two different processing-time orderings of the same inputs</em></p>

<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h3><span id="processing-time-windowing-via-triggers"><strong>Processing-Time Windowing via Triggers</strong></span><a href="#processing-time-windowing-via-triggers" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Let’s now compare this to the two processing-time methods just described.</p>
<p>First, we’ll try the triggers method. There are three aspects to making</p>
<p>processing-time “windowing” work in this manner:</p>
<p><em>Windowing</em></p>
<p>We use the global event-time window because we’re essentially emulating</p>
<p>processing-time windows with event-time panes.</p>
<p><em>Triggering</em></p>
<p>We trigger periodically in the processing-time domain based on the</p>
<p>desired size of the processing-time windows.</p>
<p><em>Accumulation</em></p>
<p>We use discarding mode to keep the panes independent from one another,</p>
<p>thus letting each of them act like an independent processing-time</p>
<p>“window.”</p>
<p>The corresponding code looks something like Example 4-1; note that global</p>
<p>windowing is the default in Beam, hence there is no specific override of the</p>
<p>108windowing strategy.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-1. Processing-time windowing via repeated, discarding panes of a</em></p>
<p><em>global event-time window</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; totals = input</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Window.triggering(Repeatedly(AlignedDelay(ONE_MINUTE)))</span><br><span class="line">             .discardingFiredPanes())</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>When executed on a streaming runner against our two different orderings of</p>
<p>the input data, the results look like Figure 4-3. Here are some interesting notes</p>
<p>about this figure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we’re emulating processing-time windows via event-time</li>
</ul>
<p>panes, the “windows” are delineated in the processing-time axis,</p>
<p>which means their effective width is measured on the y-axis instead</p>
<p>of the x-axis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because processing-time windowing is sensitive to the order that</li>
</ul>
<p>input data are encountered, the results for each of the “windows”</p>
<p>differs for each of the two observation orders, even though the events</p>
<p>themselves technically happened at the same times in each version.</p>
<p>On the left we get 12, 18, 18, whereas on the right we get 7, 36, 5.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-3. Processing-time “windowing” via triggers, over two different processing-time orderings of</em></p>
<p><em>the same inputs</em></p>
</details>







<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h3><span id="processing-time-windowing-via-ingress-time"><strong>Processing-Time Windowing via Ingress Time</strong></span><a href="#processing-time-windowing-via-ingress-time" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Lastly, let’s look at processing-time windowing achieved by mapping the</p>
<p>event times of input data to be their ingress times. Code-wise, there are four</p>
<p>aspects worth mentioning here:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Time-shifting</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When elements arrive, their event times need to be overwritten with the</p>
<p>time of ingress. We can do this in Beam by providing a new DoFn that sets</p>
<p>the timestamp of the element to the current time via the</p>
<p>outputWithTimestamp method.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Windowing</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Return to using standard event-time fixed windowing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Triggering</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Because ingress time affords the ability to calculate a perfect watermark,</p>
<p>we can use the default trigger, which in this case implicitly fires exactly</p>
<p>once when the watermark passes the end of the window.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Accumulation mode</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Because we only ever have one output per window, the accumulation</p>
<p>mode is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The actual code might thus look something like that in Example 4-2.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-2. Processing-time windowing via repeated, discarding panes of a</em></p>
<p><em>global event-time window</em></p>
<p><code>PCollection&lt;String&gt; raw = IO.read().apply(ParDo.of(</code></p>
<p><code>new DoFn&lt;String, String&gt;() {</code></p>
<p><code>public void processElement(ProcessContext c) {</code></p>
<p><code>c.outputWithTimestmap(new Instant());</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>});</code></p>
<p><code>PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; input =</code></p>
<p><code>raw.apply(ParDo.of(new ParseFn());</code></p>
<p><code>PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; totals = input</code></p>
<p><code>.apply(Window.info(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))</code></p>
<p><code>.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());</code></p>
<p>Execution on a streaming engine would look like Figure 4-4. As data arrive,</p>
<p>their event times are updated to match their ingress times (i.e., the processing</p>
<p>times at arrival), resulting in a rightward horizontal shift onto the ideal</p>
<p>watermark line. Here are some interesting notes about this figure:</p>
<ul>
<li>As with the other processing-time windowing example, we get</li>
</ul>
<p>different results when the ordering of inputs changes, even though</p>
<p>the values and event times for the input stay constant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the other example, the windows are once again delineated in</li>
</ul>
<p>the event-time domain (and thus along the x-axis). Despite this, they</p>
<p>aren’t bonafide event-time windows; we’ve simply mapped</p>
<p>processing time onto the event-time domain, erasing the original</p>
<p>record of occurrence for each input and replacing it with a new one</p>
<p>that instead represents the time the datum was first observed by the</p>
<p>pipeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite this, thanks to the watermark, trigger firings still happen at</li>
</ul>
<p>exactly the same time as in the previous processing-time example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the output values produced are identical to that</p>
<p>example, as predicted: 12, 18, 18 on the left, and 7, 36, 5 on the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because perfect watermarks are possible when using ingress time,</li>
</ul>
<p>the actual watermark matches the ideal watermark, ascending up and</p>
<p>to the right with a slope of one.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-4. Processing-time windowing via the use of ingress time, over two different processing-time</em></p>
<p><em>orderings of the same inputs</em></p>
<p>Although it’s interesting to see the different ways you can implement</p>
<p>processing-time windowing, the big takeaway here is the one I’ve been</p>
<p>harping on since the first chapter: event-time windowing is order-agnostic, at</p>
<p>least in the limit (actual panes along the way might differ until the input</p>

<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h1><span id="where-session-windows">*<strong>Where*: Session Windows</strong></span><a href="#where-session-windows" class="header-anchor">#</a></h1><p>Enough with processing-time windowing. Let’s now go back to tried-and-true</p>
<p>event-time windowing, but now we’re going to look at one of my favorite</p>
<p>features: the dynamic, data-driven windows called <em>sessions</em>.</p>
<p>Sessions are a special type of window that captures a period of activity in the</p>
<p>data that is terminated by a gap of inactivity. They’re particularly useful in</p>
<p>data analysis because they can provide a view of the activities for a specific</p>
<p>user over a specific period of time during which they were engaged in some</p>
<p>activity. This allows for the correlation of activities within the session,</p>
<p>drawing inferences about levels of engagement based on the lengths of the</p>
<p>sessions, and so on.</p>
<p>From a windowing perspective, sessions are particularly interesting in two</p>
<p>ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are an example of a <em>data-driven window</em>: the location and sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>of the windows are a direct consequence of the input data</p>
<p>themselves, rather than being based on some predefined pattern</p>
<p>within time, as are fixed and sliding windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are also an example of an <em>unaligned window</em>; that is, a window</li>
</ul>
<p>that does not apply uniformly across the data, but instead only to a</p>
<p>specific subset of the data (e.g., per user). This is in contrast to</p>
<p>aligned windows like fixed and sliding windows, which typically</p>
<p>apply uniformly across the data.</p>
<p>For some use cases, it’s possible to tag the data within a single session with a</p>
<p>common identifier ahead of time (e.g., a video player that emits heartbeat</p>
<p>pings with quality-of-service information; for any given viewing, all of the</p>
<p>pings can be tagged ahead of time with a single session ID). In this case,</p>
<p>sessions are much easier to construct because it’s basically just a form of</p>
<p>grouping by key.</p>
<p>However, in the more general case (i.e., where the actual session itself is not</p>
<p>known ahead of time), the sessions must be constructed from the locations of</p>
<p>the data within time alone. When dealing with out-of-order data, this becomes</p>
<p>particularly tricky.</p>
<p>Figure 4-5 shows an example of this, with five independent records grouped</p>
<p>together into session windows with a gap timeout of 60 minutes. Each record</p>
<p>starts out in a 60-minute window of its own (a proto-session). Merging</p>
<p>together overlapping proto-sessions yields the two larger session windows</p>
<p>containing three and two records, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-5. Unmerged proto-session windows, and the resultant merged sessions</em></p>
<p>They key insight in providing general session support is that a complete</p>
<p>session window is, by definition, a composition of a set of smaller,</p>
<p>overlapping windows, each containing a single record, with each record in the</p>
<p>sequence separated from the next by a gap of inactivity no larger than a</p>
<p>predefined timeout. Thus, even if we observe the data in the session out of</p>
<p>order, we can build up the final session simply by merging together any</p>
<p>overlapping windows for individual data as they arrive.</p>
<p>To look at this another way, consider the example we’ve been using so far. If</p>
<p>we specify a session timeout of one minute, we would expect to identify two</p>
<p>sessions in the data, delineated in Figure 4-6 by the dashed black lines. Each</p>
<p>of those sessions captures a burst of activity from the user, with each event in</p>
<p>the session separate by less than one minute from at least one other event in</p>
<p>the session.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-6. Sessions we want to compute</em></p>
<p>To see how the window merging works to build up these sessions over time</p>
<p>as events are encountered, let’s look at it in action. We’ll take the early&#x2F;late</p>
<p>code with retractions enabled from Example 2-10 and update the windowing</p>
<p>to build sessions with a one-minute gap duration timeout instead. Example 4-</p>
<p>3 illustrates what this looks like.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-3. Early&#x2F;on-time&#x2F;late firings with session windows and retractions</em></p>

<p>Executed on a streaming engine, you’d get something like that shown in</p>
<p>Figure 4-7 (note that I’ve left in the dashed black lines annotating the</p>
<p>expected final sessions for reference).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-7. Early and late firings with session windows and retractions on a streaming engine</em></p>
<p>There’s quite a lot going on here, so I’ll walk you through some of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the first record with value 5 is encountered, it’s placed into a</li>
</ul>
<p>single proto-session window that begins at that record’s event time</p>
<p>and spans the width of the session gap duration; for example, one</p>
<p>minute beyond the point at which that datum occurred. Any windows</p>
<p>we encounter in the future that overlap this window should be part of</p>
<p>the same session and will be merged into it as such.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second record to arrive is the 7, which similarly is placed into its</li>
</ul>
<p>own proto-session window, given that it doesn’t overlap with the</p>
<p>window for the 5.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the meantime, the watermark has passed the end of the first</li>
</ul>
<p>window, so the value of 5 is materialized as an on-time result just</p>
<p>before 12:06. Shortly thereafter, the second window is also</p>
<p>materialized as a speculative result with value 7, right as processing</p>
<p>time hits 12:06.</p>
<ul>
<li>We next observe a pair of records 3 and 4, the proto-sessions for</li>
</ul>
<p>which overlap. As a result, they are merged together, and by the time</p>
<p>the early trigger for 12:07 fires, a single window with value 7 is</p>
<p>emitted.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the 8 arrives shortly thereafter, it overlaps with both of the</li>
</ul>
<p>windows with value 7. All three are thus merged together, forming a</p>
<p>new combined session with value 22. When the watermark then</p>
<p>passes the end of this session, it materializes both the new session</p>
<p>with value 22 as well as retractions for the two windows of value 7</p>
<p>that were previously emitted, but later incorporated into it.</p>
<ul>
<li>A similar dance occurs when the 9 arrives late, joining the proto</li>
</ul>
<p>session with value 5 and session with value 22 into a single larger</p>
<p>session of value 36. The 36 and the retractions for the 5 and 22</p>
<p>windows are all emitted immediately by the late data trigger.</p>
<p>This is some pretty powerful stuff. And what’s really awesome is how easy it</p>
<p>is to describe something like this within a model that breaks apart the</p>
<p>dimensions of stream processing into distinct, composable pieces. In the end,</p>
<p>you can focus more on the interesting business logic at hand, and less on the</p>
<p>minutiae of shaping the data into some usable form.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe me, check out this blog post describing how to manually</p>
<p>build up sessions on Spark Streaming 1.x (note that this is not done to point</p>
<p>fingers at them; the Spark folks had just done a good enough job with</p>
<p>everything else that someone actually bothered to go to the trouble of</p>
<p>documenting what it takes to build a specific variety of sessions support on</p>
<p>top of Spark 1.x; you can’t say the same for most other systems out there).</p>
<p>It’s quite involved, and they’re not even doing proper event-time sessions, or</p>
<p>providing speculative or late firings, or retractions.</p>

<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h1><span id="where-custom-windowing"><strong><em>Where</em>: Custom Windowing</strong></span><a href="#where-custom-windowing" class="header-anchor">#</a></h1><p>Up until now, we’ve talked primarily about predefined types of windowing</p>
<p>strategies: fixed, sliding, and sessions. You can get a lot of mileage out of</p>
<p>standard types of windows, but there are plenty of real-world use cases for</p>
<p>which being able to define a custom windowing strategy can really save the</p>
<p>day (three of which we’re about to see now).</p>
<p>Most systems today don’t support custom windowing to the degree that it’s</p>
<p>supported in Beam, so we focus on the Beam approach. In Beam, a custom</p>
<p>windowing strategy consists of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>This places each element into an initial window. At the limit, this allows</p>
<p>every element to be placed within a unique window, which is very</p>
<p>powerful.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Optional) window merging</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows windows to merge at grouping times, which makes it possible</p>
<p>for windows to evolve over time, which we saw in action earlier with</p>
<p>session windows.</p>
<p>To give you a sense for how simple windowing strategies really are, and also</p>
<p>how useful custom windows support can be, we’re going to look in detail at</p>
<p>the stock implementations of fixed windows and sessions in Beam and then</p>
<p>consider a few real-world use cases that require custom variations on those</p>
<p>themes. In the process, we’ll see both how easy it is to create a custom</p>
<p>windowing strategy, and how limiting the lack of custom windowing support</p>
<p>can be when your use case doesn’t quite fit into the stock approaches.</p>
<h3><span id="variations-on-fixed-windows"><strong>Variations on Fixed Windows</strong></span><a href="#variations-on-fixed-windows" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>To begin, let’s look at the relatively simple strategy of fixed windows. The</p>
<p>stock fixed-windows implementation is as straightforward as you might</p>
<p>imagine, and consists of the following logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The element is placed into the appropriate fixed-window based on its</p>
<p>timestamp and the window’s size and offset parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging</li>
</ul>
<p>None.</p>
<p>An abbreviated version of the code looks like Example 4-4.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-4. Abbreviated FixedWindows implementation</em></p>
<p><code>public class FixedWindows extends WindowFn&lt;Object, IntervalWindow&gt; {</code></p>
<p><code>private final Duration size;</code></p>
<p><code>private final Duration offset;</code></p>
<p><code>public Collection&lt;IntervalWindow&gt; assignWindow(AssignContext c) {</code></p>
<p><code>long start = c.timestamp().getMillis() - c.timestamp()</code></p>
<p><code>.plus(size)</code></p>
<p><code>.minus(offset)</code></p>
<p><code>.getMillis() % size.getMillis();</code></p>
<p><code>return Arrays.asList(IntervalWindow(new Instant(start), size));</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the point of showing you the code here isn’t so much to</p>
<p>teach you how to write windowing strategies (although it’s nice to demystify</p>
<p>them and call out how simple they are). It’s really to help contrast the</p>
<p>comparative ease and difficulty of supporting some relatively basic use cases,</p>
<p>both with and without custom windowing, respectively. Let’s consider two</p>
<p>such use cases that are variations on the fixed-windows theme now.</p>
</details>



<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><p><strong>Unaligned fixed windows</strong></p>
<p>One characteristic of the default fixed-windows implementation that we</p>
<p>alluded to previously is that windows are aligned across all of the data. In our</p>
<p>running example, the window from noon to 1 PM for any given team aligns</p>
<p>with the corresponding windows for all other teams, which also extend from</p>
<p>noon to 1 PM. And in use cases for which you want to compare like windows</p>
<p>across another dimension, such as between teams, this alignment is very</p>
<p>useful. However, it comes at a somewhat subtle cost. All of the active</p>
<p>windows from noon to 1 PM become complete at around the same time,</p>
<p>which means that once an hour the system is hit with a massive load of</p>
<p>windows to materialize.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, let’s look at a concrete example (Example 4-5). We’ll</p>
<p>begin with a score summation pipeline as we’ve used in most examples, with</p>
<p>fixed two-minute windows, and a single watermark trigger.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-5. Watermark completeness trigger (same as Example 2-6)</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; totals = input</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))</span><br><span class="line">.triggering(AfterWatermark()))</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>But in this instance, we’ll look at two different keys (see Figure 4-8) from the</p>
<p>same dataset in parallel. What we’ll see is that the outputs for those two keys</p>
<p>are all aligned, on account of the windows being aligned across all of the</p>
<p>keys. As a result, we end up with <em>N</em> panes being materialized every time the</p>
<p>watermark passes the end of a window, where <em>N</em> is the number of keys with</p>
<p>updates in that window. In this example, where <em>N</em> is 2, that’s maybe not too</p>
<p>painful. But when <em>N</em> starts to order in the thousands, millions, or more, that</p>
<p>synchronized burstiness can become problematic.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-8. Aligned fixed windows</em></p>
<p>In circumstances for which comparing across windows is unnecessary, it’s</p>
<p>often more desirable to spread window completion load out evenly across</p>
<p>time. This makes system load more predictable, which can reduce the</p>
<p>provisioning requirements for handling peak load. In most systems, however,</p>
<p>unaligned fixed windows are only available if the system provides support for</p>
<p>them out of the box.  But with custom-windowing support, it’s a relatively</p>
<p>trivial modification to the default fixed-windows implementation to provide</p>
<p>unaligned fixed-windows support. What we want to do is continue</p>
<p>guaranteeing that the windows for all elements being grouped together (i.e.,</p>
<p>the ones with the same key) have the same alignment, while relaxing the</p>
<p>alignment restriction across different keys. The code changes to the default</p>
<p>fixed-windowing strategy and looks something like Example 4-6.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-6. Abbreviated UnalignedFixedWindows implementation</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public class UnalignedFixedWindows</span><br><span class="line">extends WindowFn&lt;KV&lt;K, V&gt;, IntervalWindow&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">private final Duration size;</span><br><span class="line">private final Duration offset;</span><br><span class="line">public Collection&lt;IntervalWindow&gt; assignWindow(AssignContext c) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">long perKeyShift = hash(c.element().key()) % size;</span><br><span class="line">long start = perKeyShift + c.timestamp().getMillis()</span><br><span class="line">-c.timestamp()</span><br><span class="line">.plus(size)</span><br><span class="line">.minus(offset)</span><br><span class="line">return Arrays.asList(IntervalWindow(new Instant(start), size));</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>With this change, the windows for all elements <em>with the same key</em> are</p>
<p>aligned, but the windows for elements <em>with different keys</em> will (typically) be</p>
<p>unaligned, thus spreading window completion load out at the cost of also</p>
<p>making comparisons across keys somewhat less meaningful. We can switch</p>
<p>our pipeline to use our new windowing strategy, illustrated in Example 4-7.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-7. Unaligned fixed windows with a single watermark trigger</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; totals = input</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Window.into(UnalignedFixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))</span><br><span class="line">.triggering(AfterWatermark()))</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And then you can see what this looks like in Figure 4-9 by comparing</p>
<p>different fixed-window alignments across the same dataset as before (in this</p>
<p>case, I’ve chosen a maximal phase shift between the two alignments to most</p>
<p>clearly call out the benefits, given that randomly chosen phases across a large</p>
<p>number of keys will result in similar effects).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-9. Unaligned fixed windows</em></p>
<p>Note how there are no instances where we emit multiple panes for multiple</p>
<p>keys simultaneously. Instead, the panes arrive individually at a much more</p>
<p>even cadence. This is another example of being able to make trade-offs in one</p>
<p>dimension (ability to compare across keys) in exchange for benefits in another</p>
<p>dimension (reduced peak resource provisioning requirements) when the use</p>
<p>case allows. Such flexibility is critical when you’re trying to process massive</p>
<p>quantities of data as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s now look at a second variation on fixed windows, one which is more</p>
<p>intrinsically tied to the data being processed.</p>
</details>



<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><p><strong>Per-element&#x2F;key fixed windows</strong></p>
<p>Our second example comes courtesy of one of the early adopters of Cloud</p>
<p>Dataflow. This company generates analytics data for its customers, but each</p>
<p>customer is allowed to configure the window size over which it wants to</p>
<p>aggregate its metrics. In other words, each customer gets to define the specific</p>
<p>size of its fixed windows.</p>
<p>Supporting a use case like this isn’t too difficult as long the number of</p>
<p>available window sizes is itself fixed. For example, you could imagine</p>
<p>offering the option of choosing 30-minute, 60-minute, and 90-minute fixed</p>
<p>windows and then running a separate pipeline (or fork of the pipeline) for</p>
<p>each of those options. Not ideal, but not too horrible. However, that rapidly</p>
<p>becomes intractable as the number of options increases, and in the limit of</p>
<p>providing support for truly arbitrary window sizes (which is what this</p>
<p>customer’s use case required) is entirely impractical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, because each record the customer processes is already annotated</p>
<p>with metadata describing the desired size of window for aggregation,</p>
<p>supporting arbitrary, per-user fixed-window size was as simple as changing a</p>
<p>couple of lines from the stock fixed-windows implementation, as</p>
<p>demonstrated in Example 4-8.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-8. Modified (and abbreviated) FixedWindows implementation that</em></p>
<p><em>supports per-element window sizes</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">public class PerElementFixedWindows&lt;T extends HasWindowSize%gt;</span><br><span class="line">extends WindowFn&lt;T, IntervalWindow&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">private final Duration offset;</span><br><span class="line">public Collection&lt;IntervalWindow&gt; assignWindow(AssignContext c) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">long perElementSize = c.element().getWindowSize();</span><br><span class="line">long start = perKeyShift + c.timestamp().getMillis()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<ul>
<li><code>c.timestamp()</code></li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">.plus(size)</span><br><span class="line">.minus(offset)</span><br><span class="line">.getMillis() % size.getMillis();</span><br><span class="line">return Arrays.asList(IntervalWindow(</span><br><span class="line">new Instant(start), perElementSize));</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>With this change, each element is assigned to a fixed window with the</p>
<p>appropriate size, as dictated by metadata carried around in the element itself. Changing the pipeline code to use this new strategy is again trivial, as shown</p>
<p>in Example 4-9.</p>
<p><em>Example 4-9. Per-element fixed-window sizes with a single watermark trigger</em></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">PCollection&lt;KV&lt;Team, Integer&gt;&gt; totals = input</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Window.into(PerElementFixedWindows.of(TWO_MINUTES))</span><br><span class="line">.triggering(AfterWatermark()))</span><br><span class="line">.apply(Sum.integersPerKey());</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And then looking at an this pipeline in action (Figure 4-10), it’s easy to see</p>
<p>that the elements for Key A all have two minutes as their window size,</p>
<p>whereas the elements for Key B have one-minute window sizes.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-10. Per-key custom-sized fixed windows</em></p>
<p>This really isn’t something you would ever reasonably expect a system to</p>
<p>provide to you; the nature of where window size preferences are stored is too</p>
<p>use-case specific for it to make sense to try to build into a standard API.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as exhibited by this customer’s needs, use cases like this do</p>
<p>exist. That’s why the flexibility provided by custom windowing is so</p>
<p>powerful.</p>

<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h3><span id="variations-on-session-windows"><strong>Variations on Session Windows</strong></span><a href="#variations-on-session-windows" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>To really drive home the usefulness of custom windowing, let’s look at one</p>
<p>final example, which is a variation on sessions. Session windowing is</p>
<p>understandably a bit more complex than fixed windows. Its implementation</p>
<p>consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each element is initially placed into a proto-session window that begins at</p>
<p>the element’s timestamp and extends for the gap duration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging</li>
</ul>
<p>At grouping time, all eligible windows are sorted, after which any</p>
<p>overlapping windows are merged together.</p>
<p>An abbreviated version of the sessions code (hand merged together from a</p>

<p>As before, the point of seeing the code isn’t so much to teach you how custom</p>
<p>windowing functions are implemented, or even what the implementation of</p>
<p>sessions looks like; it’s really to show the ease with which you can support</p>
<p>new use via custom windowing.</p>
</details>



<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><p><strong>Bounded sessions</strong></p>
<p>One such custom use case I’ve come across multiple times is bounded</p>
<p>sessions: sessions that are not allowed to grow beyond a certain size, either in</p>
<p>time, element count, or some other dimension. This can be for semantic</p>
<p>reasons, or it can simply be an exercise in spam protection. However, given</p>
<p>the variations in types of limits (some use cases care about total session size</p>
<p>in event time, some care about total element count, some care about element</p>
<p>density, etc.), it’s difficult to provide a clean and concise API for bounded</p>
<p>sessions. Much more practical is allowing users to implement their own</p>
<p>custom windowing logic, tailored to their specific use case. An example of</p>
<p>one such use case, in which session windows are time-limited, might look</p>
<p>something like Example 4-11 (eliding some of the builder boilerplate we’ll</p>
<p>utilize here).</p>

<p>As always, updating our pipeline (the early&#x2F;on-time&#x2F;late version of it, from</p>
<p>Example 2-7, in this case) to use this custom windowing strategy is trivial, as</p>
<p>you can see in Example 4-12.</p>

<p>And executed over our running example, it might then look something like</p>
<p>Figure 4-11.</p>
<p><em>Figure 4-11. Per-key custom-sized fixed windows</em></p>
<p>Note how the large session with value 36 that spanned [12:00.26, 12:05.20),</p>
<p>or nearly five minutes of time, in the unbounded sessions implementation</p>
<p>from Figure 2-7 now ends up broken apart into two shorter sessions of length</p>
<p>2 minutes and 2 minutes 53 seconds.</p>
<p>Given how few systems provide custom windowing support today, it’s worth</p>
<p>pointing out how much more effort would be required to implement such a</p>
<p>thing using a system that supported only an unbounded sessions</p>
<p>implementation. Your only real recourse would be to write code downstream</p>
<p>of the session grouping logic that looked at the generated sessions and</p>
<p>chopped them up if they exceed the length limit. This would require the</p>
<p>ability to decompose a session after the fact, which would obviate the benefits</p>
<p>of incremental aggregation (something we look at in more detail in</p>
<p>Chapter 7), increasing cost. It would also eliminate any spam protection</p>
<p>benefits one might hope to gain by limiting session lengths, because the</p>
<p>sessions would first need to grow to their full sizes before being chopped or</p>
<p>truncated.</p>
<h3><span id="one-size-does-not-fit-all"><strong>One Size Does Not Fit All</strong></span><a href="#one-size-does-not-fit-all" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>We’ve now looked at three real-world use cases, each of which was a subtle</p>
<p>variation on the stock types of windowing typically provided by data</p>
<p>processing systems: unaligned fixed windows, per-element fixed windows,</p>
<p>and bounded sessions. In all three cases, we saw how simple it was to support</p>
<p>those use cases via custom windowing and how much more difficult (or</p>
<p>expensive) it would be to support those use cases without it. Though custom</p>
<p>windowing doesn’t see broad support across the industry as yet, it’s a feature</p>
<p>that provides much needed flexibility for balancing trade-offs when building</p>
<p>data processing pipelines that need to handle complex, real-world use cases</p>
<p>over massive amounts of data as efficiently as possible.</p>
</details>



<details><summary>点击 原文</summary><h1><span id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></span><a href="#summary" class="header-anchor">#</a></h1><p>Advanced windowing is a complex and varied topic. In this chapter, we</p>
<p>covered three advanced concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processing-time windows</li>
</ul>
<p>We saw how this relates to event-time windowing, calling out the places</p>
<p>where it’s inherently useful and, most important, identifying those where</p>
<p>it’s not by specifically highlighting the stability of results that event-time</p>
<p>windowing affords us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Session windows</li>
</ul>
<p>We had our first introduction to the dynamic class of merging window</p>
<p>strategies and seeing just how much heavy lifting the system does for us</p>
<p>in providing such a powerful construct that you can simply drop into</p>
<p>place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we looked at three real-world examples of custom windows that are</p>
<p>difficult or impossible to achieve in systems that provide only a static set</p>
<p>of stock windowing strategies but relatively trivial to implement in a</p>
<p>system with custom-windowing support:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unaligned fixed windows</em>, which provide a more even distribution of</li>
</ul>
<p>outputs over time when using a watermark trigger in conjunction</p>
<p>with fixed windows.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Per-element fixed windows</em>, which provide the flexibility to</li>
</ul>
<p>dynamically choose the size of fixed windows per element (e.g., to</p>
<p>provide customizable per-user or per-ad-campaign window sizes),</p>
<p>for greater customization of the pipeline semantics to the use case at</p>
<p>hand.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bounded-session windows</em>, which limit how large a given session</li>
</ul>
<p>may grow; for example, to counteract spam attempts or to place a</p>
<p>bound on the latency for completed sessions being materialized by</p>
<p>the pipeline.</p>
<p>After deep diving through watermarks in Chapter 3 with Slava and taking a</p>
<p>broad survey of advanced windowing here, we’ve now gone well beyond the</p>
<p>basics of robust stream processing in multiple dimensions. With that, we</p>
<p>conclude our focus on the Beam Model and thus Part I of the book.</p>
<p>Up next is Reuven’s Chapter 5 on consistency guarantees, exactly-once</p>
<p>processing, and side effects, after which we begin our journey into Part II,</p>
<p><em>Streams and Tables</em> with Chapter 6.</p>
<ol>
<li>As far as I know, Apache Flink is the only other system to support custom</li>
</ol>
<p>windowing to the extent that Beam does. And to be fair, its support extends</p>
<p>even beyond that of Beam’s, thanks to the ability to provide a custom window</p>
<p>evictor. Head asplode.</p>
<ol>
<li>And I’m not actually aware of any such systems at this time.</li>
<li>This naturally implies the use of keyed data, but because windowing is</li>
</ol>
<p>intrinsically tied to grouping by key anyway, that restriction isn’t particularly</p>
<p>burdensome.</p>
<ol>
<li>And it’s not critical that the element itself know the window size; you could</li>
</ol>
<p>just as easily look up and cache the appropriate window size for whatever the</p>
<p>desired dimension is; for example, per-user.</p>
